Hello, I see that you are interested in my mod.
There are some things I suggest you know about before downloading it


1. Cowerite is found under y=20.
2. You need a diamond or netherite pick to mine it.
3. You can craft cowerite armor so far. There are no cowerite tools yet.
4. Cowerite armor is craftable by combining a piece of leather armor with a cowerite ingot in a smithing table.


Thank you for downloading and have fun!
