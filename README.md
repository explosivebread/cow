Hello, I see that you are interested in my mod.
There are some things I suggest you know about before downloading it


1. Cowerite is found under y=32.
2. You need a diamond or netherite pick to mine it.
3. You can craft cowerite armor and tools.
4. Leather tools are craftable but have almost no use.
5. Cowerite gear is craftable by combining a piece of leather gear with a cowerite ingot in a smithing table.


Thank you for downloading and have fun!
