I made this mod with Mcreator as a joke, but if you actually want to play it, here it is.
Here is the link to the mcreator website https://mcreator.net/modification/77152/cowerite-mod.

Here's a mini-wiki:

1. Cowerite is found under y=32.
2. You need a diamond or netherite pick to mine it.
3. You can craft cowerite armor and tools.
4. Leather tools are craftable but have almost no use.
5. Cowerite gear is craftable by combining a piece of leather gear with a cowerite ingot in a smithing table.
